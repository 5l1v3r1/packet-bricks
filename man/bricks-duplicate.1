.SH NAME
bricks-duplicate \- create bricks-server with duplicator settings.
.SH SYNOPSIS
bricks-duplicate iface split
.SH DESCRIPTION
bricks-duplicate runs the brick-server in daemon mode with duplicator
settings. The tool can only be executed when two additional command line
arguments are passed. The first argument 'iface' is used by the bricks-server
daemon to select the network interface from which the network traffic is
captured. The second argument 'split' is a non-zero integer which informs
the daemon how many netmap pipes needs to be created. The netmap pipes
are then connected to the interface and traffic is duplicated across
all 'split' number of netmap pipes.
