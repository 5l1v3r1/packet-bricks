Dependencies
-------------
This program builds on the netmap packet I/O framework. Please
download and install the netmap library before installing this
module.

Packet-Bricks requires LUA development libraries 5.1. The current
version of packet-bricks program would show compilation issues if 
LUA devel version 6 is installed.

Ubuntu requires the following debian packages:
1- liblua5.1-dev	(Ubuntu Debian Package)
2- lua5.1		(Ubuntu Debian Package)
3- libpcap-dev		(Ubuntu Debian Package)
4- libreadline-dev	(Ubuntu Debian Package)
5- make			(Ubuntu Debian Package)
6- gzip			(Ubuntu Debian Package)

Fedora packages:
1- compat-lua-devel	(Fedora Package)
2- compat-lua		(Fedora Package)
3- libpcap-devel	(Fedora Package)
4- readline-devel	(Fedora Package)
5- make			(Fedora Package)
6- gzip			(Fedora Package)

This program would work better if jemalloc library is installed.
5- libjemalloc-dev	(Ubuntu Debian Package), OR
5- jemalloc-devel	(Fedora Package)

FreeBSD users: please install the following packages
1- lua51
2- gmake
3- gzip

Installation process
--------------------
The installation process is straightforward.

#1. Run the configure script
$ ./configure [--with-lua-include=/usr/include/lua5.1/]  \
[--with-jemalloc-include=/usr/include/jemalloc/]

In case the path to LUA development header and library files
are not provided:

    - The configure script will try to pick up header files 
    from /usr/include/lua5.1 and library from /usr/lib for 
    Ubuntu by default.
    
    - For FreeBSD, it will try to pick the header files from
    /usr/local/include/lua51/ and libraries from /usr/local/lua51    

To compile packet bricks with broker plugin, run the configure
script as following:
$ ./configure --with-broker-include=<$PATH_TO_BROKER_INC> \
--with-broker-lib=<$PATH_TO_BROKER_LIB>

#2. Run make
$ make

# FreeBSD users, please use gmake

#3. Finally install (or `gmake install' in case of FreeBSD)
$ make install

If no errors are encountered, the make script will place the binaries
in the ${prefix}/ directory.
